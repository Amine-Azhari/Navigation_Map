okay
DAY 13 ON THIS!
GOOD News! ... And bad news
Everything is working great; Dijkstra is doing his job computing the shortest path and giving the list of nodes to track in order to take the shortest path
For that the user inserts his current position, then his destination (manually).
GUI in python is working great as well, we have cute buttons, when clicked on a button you can see its cordinates and its name. 
To do : Link between the two files so instead of inserting current position and destination, the user can just click on the buttons.
Also gotta create the adj matrix, C'EST MOOORT! TOO MANY NODES, TOO MUCH SPACE!!! Think abt adj List maybe. This is our problem to solve.
